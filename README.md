# Voron 2.4 "Crash-Free" Nozzle Brush

Please read the most up-to-date instructions here: https://remake.ai/blog/voron-2-nozzle-brush/.

When searching for a Voron 2.4 nozzle brush mod I noticed that the available mods stick up from the bed high enough to interfere with the extruder’s movement – when the extruder moves at the very back of the bed, including knocking the Klicky/Euclid probe off the extruder.

This nozzle brush sits almost flush with bed – so the extruder never crashes into the brush.

Unlike other nozzle brush mods, this one does not have a bucket. I decided to omit the bucket because the bucket tends to take up too much space that may be needed for other mods – and because under normal conditions there is hardly any plastic brushed from the nozzle anyway.

Use two M3 screws with 2020 extrusion M3 nuts to mount the nozzle holder as shown. Align the brush to be almost flush with the bed, so the nozzle does get scrubbed, but the extruder body doesn’t touch the brush – even at Z height of zero. The brush itself is made by taking a regular nozzle brush – e.g., search Amazon for “3D printer brush” – and cutting off the brush head to match the size of the holder.

Happy 3D printing!
